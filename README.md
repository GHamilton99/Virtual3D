# Virtual3D

In this project I will create a 3D display using face tracking for head tracking. Using the Haar Cascade face tracker from OpenCV to determine a person's x, y, and z location relative to a webcam. I then update hte display of a virtual tunnel according to the user's position so it has a 3D effect.
